## Conclusion

You've completed the workshop! Well done!

Before you go there are a few Golden Config feature that we didn't really cover today due to the limited time, but they are important for you to know about. **Config Replacements and Removals** allow configurations to be redacted prior to pushing them to an external git destination like GitHub. Config plans can be generated from manual config, intended config, missing config, or remediation config. The **remediation config** is the combination of adding the missing config and removing the extra config. **Custom remediation** is an extensibility feature that allows Python code that contains custom logic to be used when generating config plans for remediation. This can be installed via a Nautobot app, Python package, or directly in your Nautobot installation. **Postprocessing** is a feature that allows you to modify configurations once they have been rendered. This is particularly helpful if you need to add back the configs that was redacted by the removal and replacement rules.
